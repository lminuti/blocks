# DelphiBlocks

> **Early preview — work in progress.**

A command-line package manager for Delphi / RAD Studio. DelphiBlocks automates downloading, compiling, and registering third-party Delphi packages sourced from a GitHub-hosted registry.

## How it works

1. Reads a JSON manifest from the [blocks-repository](https://github.com/delphi-blocks/blocks-repository).
2. Downloads the package source as a ZIP from GitHub.
3. Compiles it with MSBuild against the selected Delphi version.
4. Registers the library paths in the Delphi registry and records the installation in a local database (`.blocks/`).
5. Supports multiple Delphi IDE profiles via the `registrykey` workspace setting. Delphi allows launching with an alternative registry profile using the `-r` flag (e.g. `bds.exe -r MyProfile`).
6. Supports custom package repositories. In addition to the default registry, you can add your own GitHub-hosted repositories as package sources.

## Requirements

- Windows
- Delphi / RAD Studio XE6 or later (BDS 14.0 – 37.0)
- MSBuild (bundled with RAD Studio)

## Usage

```
Commands:
  install <package>        Install a package by id (vendor.name) or name.
  uninstall <package>      Remove a package from the workspace and database.
  init                     Initialise the workspace and download the package repository.
  list                     List packages installed in the current workspace.
  product [name[:key]...]  Show detected Delphi installations.
  search [pattern]         Search the repository index by id, name, description or keywords.
  config                   Read or write workspace or system configuration values.
  view <id[@version]>      Show details of a package from the repository (latest if @version omitted).
  version                  Print the version of the blocks executable.
  upgrade                  Check for a newer release and download the setup if available.
  help [command]           Show this message, or detailed help for a specific command.
```

### Quick start

```bat
REM Install DelphiBlocks
winget install DelphiBlocks.Blocks

REM Initialise the workspace in the current directory (prompts for Delphi version)
blocks init

REM Install a package
blocks install owner.package

REM Install a specific version
blocks install owner.package@1.2.0

REM Uninstall
blocks uninstall owner.package

REM List installed packages
blocks list

REM Show detected Delphi installations
blocks product

REM Show all properties for each installation (active platforms, search paths, running status)
blocks product /detail

REM Show details for a specific version
blocks product delphi13
blocks product delphi13:blocks

REM Show details for multiple versions at once
blocks product delphi12 delphi13

REM View package info
blocks view owner.package@1.2.0
blocks view owner.package /versions

REM Manage repository sources
blocks config sources
blocks config /add sources=https://github.com/owner/my-repo
```

### Version constraints

Append `@<constraint>` to a package ID to pin or restrict the version:

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `@1.2.0` | Exact version |
| `@^1.2.0` | Same major (`>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`) |
| `@~1.2.0` | Same minor (`>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`) |
| `@>=1.0.0` | At least 1.0.0 |
| `@>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` | Explicit range |

> **Note:** In `cmd.exe` the `^` character must be escaped as `^^` (e.g. `owner.package@^^1.2.0`). In PowerShell no escaping is needed.

### The `product` command

`blocks product` lists all Delphi / RAD Studio installations found in the Windows registry. The version name shown (e.g. `delphi13`) is the value to pass as `/product` to other commands.

| Option / argument | Effect |
|-------------------|--------|
| _(none)_ | List all installed products in compact form. |
| `name[:regkey]` | Show detailed info for the named product. Repeat to show multiple. `regkey` defaults to `BDS` when omitted. |
| `/all` | List all supported Delphi versions (not just installed ones). |
| `/detail` | Show full detail for every installed product: BDS version, root directory, registry key, running status, and active platform paths. |

The **running status** checks the actual `bds.exe` command line: a profile opened with `bds.exe -r blocks` is only shown as running for the `blocks` registry key, not for `BDS` or any other profile.

With `/detail` (or when filtering by name), only **active platforms** are listed — those for which a platform SDK is configured (`Win32` and `Win64` are always active; others require a matching SDK entry under `PlatformSDKs` in the registry).

```bat
REM Compact list of all installed versions
blocks product

REM Full detail for all versions
blocks product /detail

REM Detail for delphi13 using the default BDS profile
blocks product delphi13

REM Detail for delphi12 using the "blocks" profile
blocks product delphi12:blocks
```

## Output layout

When `blocks install` compiles a package it overrides the MSBuild output paths so that artefacts live under predictable locations.

| Artefact | Output path |
|----------|-------------|
| BPL files | `.blocks\bpl\` (release) and `.blocks\bpl\debug\` (debug) |
| DCP files | `.blocks\dcp\` (release) and `.blocks\dcp\debug\` (debug) |
| DCU files | `<project>\lib\<Platform>\` (release) and `<project>\lib\<Platform>\debug\` (debug) |

The fixed BPL/DCP location makes installations under different IDE registry profiles (created with `bds.exe -r <key>`) safe: each workspace gets its own `.blocks\` tree, so artefacts from different profiles never collide.

DCU output can be left to the package's own `.dproj` by setting `packageOptions.keepProjectDcuPaths` to `true` in the manifest. This should not be used unless preserving the DCU layout declared by the `.dproj` is strictly necessary.

Both **debug** and **release** configurations are compiled for every package. After the build, Blocks registers the DCU search paths under `HKCU\Software\Embarcadero\<profile>\<BdsVersion>\Library\<Platform>` together with the manifest's `sourcePath`.

## Package manifest

Each package in the repository is described by a JSON manifest file (`<vendor>.<name>.manifest.json`). Below is an annotated example.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://delphi-blocks.dev/schema/package.v1.json",
  "id": "delphi-blocks.wirl",       // vendor.name identifier
  "name": "WiRL",                    // human-readable name
  "version": "4.6.0",
  "description": "RESTful Library for Delphi",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "homepage": "https://wirl.delphi-blocks.dev",
  "author": "Paolo Rossi, Luca Minuti <info@lucaminuti.it>",
  "keywords": ["rest", "http", "api"],

  "repository": {
    "type": "github",
    "url": "https://github.com/delphi-blocks/WiRL/tree/v4.6.0"
  },

  // "sourcePath" entries are registered in the Delphi library "Browsing Path".
  // DCU output locations come from the .dproj itself; Blocks does not override them.
  "platforms": {
    "Win32": {
      "sourcePath":     ["Source\\Core", "Source\\Client"],
      "releaseDCUPath": ["lib\\Win32\\release"],
      "debugDCUPath":   ["lib\\Win32\\debug"]
    }
  },

  // Each entry maps to a .dproj file under packages\<folder>\
  "packages": [
    { "name": "WiRL",       "type": ["runtime"] },
    { "name": "WiRLDesign", "type": ["designtime"] }
  ],

  // Maps Delphi version names to the subfolder under packages\ that contains
  // the .dproj files for that version. A trailing + means "this version or newer".
  "packageOptions": {
    "folders": {
      "delphi11":  "11.0Alexandria",
      "delphi12+": "12.0Athens"
    }
  },

  // version constraints follow semver syntax (@^x.y.z, @>=x.y.z, etc.)
  "dependencies": {
    "paolo-rossi.delphi-neon": "^3.1.0"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique package identifier in `vendor.name` form. |
| `repository.url` | GitHub tree URL pinned to a tag or commit; Blocks downloads the ZIP from this ref. |
| `platforms` | Per-platform source and DCU paths added to the Delphi library registry. |
| `packages` | List of `.dproj` files to compile; type can be `runtime`, `designtime`, or both. |
| `packageOptions.folders` | Maps Delphi version keys to the subfolder under `packages\` containing the `.dproj` files. A `+` suffix means "this version or newer". |
| `packageOptions.keepProjectDcuPaths` | Optional; defaults to `false`. When `true`, DCU output paths are taken from the `.dproj` instead of Blocks' default `<project>\lib\<Platform>\`. Should not be used unless preserving the DCU layout declared by the `.dproj` is strictly necessary. |
| `dependencies` | Other packages that must be installed first, with their version constraints. |

## Application manifest

The executable embeds `Source\blocks.manifest`, which declares:

- **Execution level** — `asInvoker` (no UAC elevation required).
- **Supported OS** — Windows 10 and Windows 11.

## Building from source

All source files are under `Source/`. The project has no external dependencies: open `Source\Blocks.dproj` in Delphi / RAD Studio and compile. The compiled executable (`Blocks.exe`) is placed in the project root.
